# Hi, I'm Oussama! 📱👨‍💻

Welcome to my corner of the internet where I build **mobile front-end applications** using **React Native** 🚀

While some developers enjoy living deep in servers and databases, I focus on what users actually touch — **interfaces, animations, layouts, and smooth interactions**. I enjoy turning designs into real, responsive mobile experiences that feel fast and intuitive (and don’t break on rotation 😅).

## What I'm Working On

- **React Native development** ⚛️: Building cross-platform mobile apps with reusable and scalable components.
- **UI & UX implementation** 🎨: Turning designs into clean, pixel-perfect mobile interfaces.
- **Layouts & responsiveness** 📐: Making apps look good on *all* screen sizes.
- **Animations & interactions** ✨: Adding subtle motion where it actually improves the experience.
- **Code quality** 🧹: Writing readable code that future me won’t complain about.

## Fun Facts About Me

- I care *way too much* about spacing, alignment, and smooth transitions.
- I’ve said “it works on my phone” more times than I’d like to admit.
- My layouts are perfect… until I test them on a smaller screen 📱😅
- I use `console.log()` as a debugging tool *and* emotional support.

## Skills & Tools

- ⚛️ **React Native**: Building real-world mobile apps.
- 🟢 **JavaScript (ES6+)**: `let` and `const` used responsibly.
- 🎨 **Styling & Layouts**: Flexbox is my best friend and worst enemy.
- 🔄 **State & Props**: Keeping UI predictable and manageable.
- 🔧 **Git & GitHub**: Version control — also known as “undo for developers”.

## Current Projects

- **Project 1**: A React Native mobile app focused on clean UI and smooth user experience.
- **Project 2**: A personal portfolio app showcasing my **mobile front-end** work (still evolving, like me).
