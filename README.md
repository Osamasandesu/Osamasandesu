# Hi, I'm Oussama! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my corner of the internet where I'm currently learning the fine art of **JavaScript**... mostly back-end stuff! 🚀 

While the world is full of shiny front-end frameworks and pretty UI designs, I'm here to deal with the magic that happens **behind the scenes**—the server-side goodness, databases, and APIs that make everything tick. 💻⚙️

## What I'm Working On

- **Backend wizardry** 🧙‍♂️: Making JavaScript talk to databases and APIs like it's my job (well, it might be soon!).
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Because why not build a server that doesn't crash every five minutes?
- **Databases**: Understanding MongoDB and SQL, because data should be organized... not just sitting around in a pile. 
- **Async/Await**: The *async* life is the best life! But, sometimes, I wonder if I should just **await** for my code to get better. 😅

## Fun Facts About Me

- I'm still figuring out if I like **back-end** more than **front-end** (but hey, if the buttons don’t click, I’m fine with that).
- My code is like pizza: even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. 🍕
- I only write **console.log()** as a form of emotional expression.
- I sometimes dream in **JavaScript errors**. Don't worry, I'm debugging my dreams too.

## Skills & Tools

- 🟢 **JavaScript**: I use `let` and `const` responsibly.
- 🔵 **Node.js**: The backend lifeline for those who don't trust their code to run without a server.
- ⚙️ **Express.js**: The router to my server-side soul.
- 🛢️ **MongoDB**: Because JSON-like data is my idea of "structured fun."
- 🔄 **Async/Await**: Life's better when you don't block the thread.
- 🔧 **Git/GitHub**: Version control... or as I call it, "A safety net for my mistakes."
  
## Current Projects

- **Project 1**: A back-end API that might or might not change the world, but at least it handles requests like a pro. 💪
- **Project 2**: A personal portfolio to showcase the *back-end* stuff I'm proud of (it’s a work in progress, like my brain).
